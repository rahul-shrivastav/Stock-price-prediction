This project focuses on predicting stock price movements using machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost. It involves preprocessing historical stock data, feature scaling, training classification models, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to determine the best algorithm for forecasting future stock trends based on past data.

## Tech Stack
- ` Python ` : versatile, high-level, interpreted, easy-to-learn programming language.
- ` Scikit-Learn `: A powerful Python library for machine learning.
- ` Numpy `: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, enabling fast array and matrix operations.
- ` Pandas `: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, built on top of NumPy.
- ` Matplotlib `:  A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- ` Seaborn `: A high-level data visualization library based on Matplotlib, offering beautiful and informative statistical graphics.



## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
